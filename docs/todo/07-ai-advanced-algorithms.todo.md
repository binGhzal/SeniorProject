# TODO 07: AI and Advanced Algorithms

- [x] Confirm model approach (heuristic, pretrained, custom)
- [ ] Define dataset scope and labeling requirements
- [ ] Add distraction path requirements (gaze/head-pose) and validation protocol
- [x] Define train/validation/test protocol and metrics
- [x] Define deployment constraints (latency, CPU, memory, power)
- [x] Define model versioning and rollout strategy

## Implementation plan

- Week 4: finalize dataset buckets (day/night, glasses, helmet fit) and labeling taxonomy.
- Week 4: execute baseline validation run and publish metric summary (latency, false alerts).
- Week 4: gate any model-based rollout on documented acceptance thresholds.
