# Rubric Checklist (SGP2 Report)

This checklist is a structured way to verify the report covers common SGP2 rubric criteria. If you have an official rubric, share it and this file can be adapted line-by-line.

## Problem + objectives

- Problem statement is specific, measurable, and tied to a real context.
- Objectives are listed and mapped to implemented features.
- Deliverables are concrete (code modules, prototype loop, tests, docs).

## Design + architecture

- Architecture diagram included and referenced in text.
- Modules are explained (sensors, detection, telemetry, orchestration).
- Integration flow is clear (inputs/outputs, topics, thresholds).

## Implementation quality

- Key algorithms described (EAR, PERCLOS-style rolling buffer, high-g threshold).
- Dependencies and environment constraints documented.
- Reproducible setup steps included.

## Testing + validation

- Testing strategy described (unit vs integration-style vs manual verification).
- Test cases are justified and trace to objectives.
- Expected outputs are included and match actual `unittest -v` run.
- Limitations are explicitly stated (what is validated vs what is not).

## Results + analysis

- Results are summarized in a table.
- Interpretation explains what the results prove and what remains unproven.
- Discussion of failure modes / false positives / assumptions.

## Professional standards + constraints

- Economic + environmental constraints discussed.
- Health/safety/security considerations included.
- Privacy and data handling discussed for camera/telemetry.

## Project management + teamwork

- Gantt chart included.
- Roles, responsibilities, and changes during SGP2 documented.
- Tools/resources used are cited.

## Writing + formatting

- Placeholder guidance text removed.
- Figures/tables are numbered and referenced.
- Citations are consistent (APA/IEEE as required by the course).
- References compile and all citations appear in bibliography.
